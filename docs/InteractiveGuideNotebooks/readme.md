# Welcome to our __Interactive guide to SolPoc__ ! 

This set of notebooks are an interactive way for beginners to learn how the package works and the physics behind it.
Their goal is to guide your learning, step by step, of how SolPOC works by starting to evaluate the optical response of your first thin layers stack until your first optimization.

They DO NOT aim to teach you how to use the main template scripts in SolPOC. 

We have split this interactive guide in 7 chapters:

- Chap 1 is to learn how to calculate reflectivity, transmissivity and absorptivity of a thin layers stack.
- Chap 2 is to learn how to use refractive index of real materials.
- Chap 3 is to learn how to use EMA (Effective Medium Approximation) for model materials as cermet or porous mixture.
- Chap 4 & 5 is to learn how to easily evaluate your thin layer stack, with an example on computing its solar performance.
- Chap 6 & 7 is to learn how to perform an optimization.
