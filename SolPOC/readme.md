Welcome to the main folder of SolPOC. This folder contain the code with the refractive index necessary for the code. 


This folder contain :

- A subfolder name Materials, witch contain data for the code. The data as present as texte files for be readable for the code. Materials folder contain refractive index of real materials; mostly founded is peer reviewed litterature of refractiveindex.info web site. Other data, as solar spectra are also available
- A `function_SolPOC.py`. This files contain all functions for `CurveRTA.py`and `optimization_multiprocess.py` work.
