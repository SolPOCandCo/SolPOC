Files required for code operation
Material contains all the complex refractive indices of the materials, as text files.
The name of each text file corresponds to a material

Each text file contains three columns
1. wavelengths (in nm)
2. The real part of the complex refractive index 
3. The imaginary part of the complex refractive index
